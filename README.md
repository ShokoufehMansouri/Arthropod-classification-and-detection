This project is for ADVANCED MACHINE LEARNING course.
The classification and the detection of arthropods is the goal of this work. The model used is the Faster R-CNN approach, tested considering two possible 
pre-trained CNN architectures to be our candidate backbone. By means of this Deep Learning algorithm, we made some meaningful analysis on the results obtained
from the training/fine-tuning phase, in which we reached an Average Precision value (AP) close to 70%, and an overall classification accuracy, on 8 classes, 
of 65%.
